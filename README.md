# TBImagePickerController

A `UIImagePickerController` that displays a `UIActionSheet` to select the source type (camera or library) if the current device has a camera.
If not, it uses the library automatically.

## Usage
Allocate and initialize as usual.
When presented (e.g. in a `UIPopoverController`) the selection sheet is displayed automatically if necessary.
